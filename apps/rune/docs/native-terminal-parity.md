# Native terminal port

The terminal panel renders a real VT100/ANSI cell grid directly in Rune. It uses
OpenCode's existing theme tokens, monospaced text, per-cell SGR colors and a
minimum contrast adjustment. No browser terminal is embedded.

## Implemented behavior

- Explicit Start creates a local native PTY, an interactive OpenSSH PTY for a
  saved SSH destination, or a durable remote `/api/host-terminal` shell.
  Source failures never fall back to a different machine or create an agent.
- Tabs retain connection fingerprint, profile and working directory. Hiding a
  pane does not terminate its shell. Connection/profile retirement detaches
  remote viewers and releases owned native processes/readers.
- Keyboard input, application cursor/keypad modes, function keys, Ctrl-C,
  Ctrl-R, terminal Ctrl/Cmd-W routing, bracketed paste, Unicode/IME composition,
  mouse reporting, force-selection, scrollback and resize are implemented.
- Text selection supports copy, adding a quote to the captured chat draft,
  full retained-output selection, search, and explicit opening of HTTP(S)
  hyperlinks, including OSC8 labels. Copy without a selection preserves the
  shell interrupt behavior.
- The overflow menu is an overlay; opening it does not resize the shell. Tabs
  support individual close, close others/all, and explicit forgetting of an
  unavailable shell when its close cannot be acknowledged.
- Native PTY output readers are cancellable and input writes are queued.
  File uploads run separately, so staging a remote path does not freeze PTY
  input or cancellation. SSH and remote drops upload actual file bytes through
  their captured gateway/profile before inserting the returned remote path.
- Local working directories are tracked through the owned process on Linux;
  OSC7 also updates cwd. SSH supports both POSIX and PowerShell command forms.
  The explicit platform switch applies to new SSH tabs.
- Remote reconnect always uses the same durable `terminalId`. Metadata must
  match that identity; binary replay replaces the viewport and suppresses
  terminal query replies. Trimmed replay triggers an actual resize/redraw.
  Reconnect is bounded. A start whose identity was not acknowledged is never
  automatically repeated.
- Explicit remote close uses `attach=<id>&action=close` and requires matching
  closed metadata followed by normal closure. An unconfirmed close retains
  the tab and identity for retry.
- Agent process tabs are read-only mirrors, fed by scoped
  `agent.terminal.output` and `process.list` snapshots. Stream/snapshot overlap
  is deduplicated. Closing a mirror does not kill its process or resurrect the
  tab on the next poll; explicit open restores it.
- Private client state persists tab identities/cwd and bounded local ANSI
  scrollback. Restoring metadata never starts a new process. Remote shells
  restore detached with their durable identity and authoritative server replay.
  Synthetic scenes neither load nor save real terminal state.

## Integration API

`Terminal::new/init`, `set_owner(Connection, DraftScope, cwd, ssh)`, `poll`,
`action`, `rehome`, `close_connection` and `close_profile` own lifecycle.
`view::terminal::panel/on_key/on_ime` render and route focused input.
`agent_event`, `sync_processes` and `open_process` supply process mirrors.

Conversation updates expose owned raw agent-terminal events. The existing
scoped page worker performs `Conversation::process_request` reads, preserving
runtime identity and rejecting stale owner responses. Folder changes use
`Conversation::set_cwd` on the retained conversation worker, with a retained
canonical request ID, revision/generation fences, busy denial and authoritative
normalized readback. They never become a fresh generic PageRPC mutation.

## Evidence and limits

The focused terminal suite verifies real Linux PTY input, kernel resize, ANSI
output and exit ordering; controlled real WebSocket metadata/replay/reconnect
and close receipts; parser behavior, Unicode scrollback/search, read-only
process mirrors and synthetic isolation. Conversation contracts separately
verify the normalized session-owned folder mutation/readback without a prompt.

No agent process was started or modified during these tests. Live SSH was not
used: SSH argument construction, quoting and source selection are covered by
synthetic tests. macOS PTYs, Windows ConPTY/PowerShell and actual SSH host/device
acceptance remain unverified in this Linux environment. The native code uses
portable-pty and OpenSSH rather than agent installation or lifecycle commands.

## Webapp host-terminal ticket compatibility (2026-11-02)

Current Hermes Webapp requires a socket-specific one-use ticket for
`/api/host-terminal`; a standing session token alone receives HTTP 403. On a
rejected non-native upgrade, the client now asks the same captured gateway and
profile for a host-terminal ticket, then retries that rejected upgrade without
the standing token in the WebSocket URL. Each open, reconnect and close dial
gets its own ticket. Older gateways that accept the original connection keep
using it. A rejected ticket request does not fall back to a shell on another
host.

The focused ticket regression failed before the change and passed after it;
the 12 existing terminal tests and the Linux common suite (966 passed, 15
ignored) also passed. A Linux native-window run used the pinned Hermes backend
with its actual Webapp terminal lifespan enabled in an isolated fixture. The
remote terminal opened, executed `pwd` in the selected project directory, and
closed with its owning receipt. The tested binary SHA-256 was
`6e39a767ab7a847ad9bcfc8caf9a70761828ce83d88bd3a8373e56145a8c436b`.
This is not a full Webapp deployment, SSH, macOS or real-provider acceptance.

The pinned headless `hermes serve` surface does not offer host-terminal tickets
or shells; its rejection remains visible and no local shell is substituted.
Evidence, including intermediate fixture failures, is retained under
`standalone-desktop-artifacts/terminal-webapp-ticket-20261102/`.
