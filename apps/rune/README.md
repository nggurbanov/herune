# Herune

A standalone native desktop client for Hermes agents. Rune and OpenCode supply native
controls, fonts and both appearances; Hermes retains its navigation, identities,
conversation ownership and split/group layout. Agents remain independently
installed and managed. The retained Electron client is the behavior baseline.

**Full functional parity is in progress.** The app now sends and streams real
turns, handles stop/admissions/approval/clarify, edits agent settings and supports
native audio. This is a development build, not a completed migration. See
[functional parity](docs/functional-parity.md) for implemented behavior and open
acceptance work; the feature inventories retain the complete target scope.

## Build and run

Rust 1.95+ is required. On Debian/Ubuntu the native build needs the Rune graphics
headers, ALSA, GTK/WebKitGTK 4.1, Opus and the AEC build toolchain:

```sh
sudo apt install libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev libasound2-dev \
  libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libopus-dev cmake meson ninja-build libclang-dev llvm \
  gstreamer1.0-nice gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
npm run dev:rune
npm run dev:rune -- --local-home /absolute/path/to/hermes-home
npm run dev:rune -- --gateway https://existing-gateway.example/prefix
```

A GPU/Vulkan driver is needed; Mesa software Vulkan works in a VM. XDG portals
provide native dialogs on Linux. Local private-ticket discovery is currently
verified on Linux; macOS/Windows local discovery and distribution acceptance
remain open. The minimum native window is 1024×520 logical pixels.

Local attach never starts, installs or updates an agent. Saved Local, Remote and
SSH connections use client-owned metadata and OS credential storage. SSH forwards
to an existing gateway with strict host-key validation. A one-time URL token can
also be entered in the secure form or supplied through `HERMES_GATEWAY_TOKEN`.
The client does not store credentials in its JSON preferences or plugin child.

The Command Center exposes explicit backend maintenance/update/restart actions;
these operate the selected external agent only after the corresponding user
invocation. They are independent from desktop installation and startup.

## Direct OAuth connections

Settings → Connections → Profile routing supports an existing gateway URL with
OAuth. Save the URL, select Sign in and complete the native PKCE flow in the
browser. Tokens remain in the OS credential store.

Remote dashboards keep the same ticket-based WebSocket and session protocol as
the retained Electron client. A missing `runtime.describe` method is supported
for a named profile verified against that server's authenticated roster. An
unmapped per-profile override needs its backend profile selected explicitly.
Authentication errors, timeouts and malformed runtime evidence never trigger a
compatibility fallback. Local native gateways still require runtime authority.
No server proxy, agent update or server configuration change is required.

## Current surfaces

- Hermes Sessions/Bots navigation, canonical Bot Chats, conversation tabs,
  sidebar sources/pins/filtering, bot/profile identity management and archives.
- T3 Code-style multiline composer, provider/model search and favorites,
  a compact model summary and one reasoning/tier/approval popover, real file
  upload and durable prepared sends. Every existing chat tab retains its actual
  editor, attachments and pending model choices; late dialogs return to the
  originating input. Hermes dictation and voice actions remain.
- Native rich transcript, earlier history, canonical edit/retry/restore/branch
  with durable mutation recovery, copy/quote/read aloud, tools and images.
- Complete native peer windows use the same Herune application factory, with
  independently claimed editors, captured sources/profiles, interactive sessions
  and Bot Chat targets. Close Window and Quit are separate commands. Remaining
  lifetime/default/restore/platform work is tracked in
  [native window parity](docs/native-full-windows-parity.md).
- Separate native Rune subagent windows: lazy read-only history/streaming,
  focus/reuse, theme propagation and viewer-only closure.
- Settings, Capabilities, Messaging, Artifacts, Scheduled jobs, saved Connections
  and Command Center with real scoped read/write operations and failure states.
- Dictation into drafts, STT/Hermes/TTS conversation, wake listening, spoken
  replies and GPT-Live. Linux uses native WebRTC/Opus with WebRTC AEC3; actual
  provider/device/platform acceptance limits are in [voice parity](docs/voice-parity.md).
- Files tree/text editor with read-before-save, conflict preservation, local
  Rename/Trash, scoped remote access, native image/audio previews and streaming
  download. Audio supports paused metadata, seeking, volume/mute, pitch-preserving
  0.25–4× speed and exact original saving. Inline/concurrent media, remaining
  containers and video/PDF/HTML acceptance are still tracked in the ledger.
- Persistent split/group pane layout with native docking, stacked tabs,
  minimize/close/reopen and divider resizing. More original presets/tile/window
  interactions remain in scope.
- Original React Hermes GUI SDK/runtime in an owned native WebView process,
  including bundled Bots UI. Native Rune remains the application shell. The SDK
  uses authenticated opaque native socket/REST brokers. See [notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

Terminal and Review implementation/acceptance is tracked in the parity ledger;
no hidden placeholder counts as a completed feature. Client state lives under
its own OS state directory, never under an agent home. Drafts and overlays are
scoped by connection principal/profile/stored session. Unknown send outcomes are
reconciled with their original identity rather than automatically resent.

Native `--scene` states use synthetic data and disable backend mutation. Useful
scenes include `reader`, `chat-working`, `chat-decisions`, `bot-manager`,
`connections`, `settings`, `capabilities`, `messaging`, `artifacts`, `cron`,
`command-center`, `terminal`, `file-preview`, `layout`, `composer`, `models`,
`reasoning` / `permissions` (the same combined model-settings menu), `rich-chat`,
`subagents`, `voice` and `voice-engine`. Combine with `--theme`
`light`/`dark`, `--tree /tmp/tree.json` and `--snap /tmp/screenshot.png`.

`--check-connection ... --check-pages` is a separate read-only probe. Real agent
mutations, provider calls, prompts and human microphone access are excluded from
the automated acceptance suite. The optional virtual audio test uses its own
Pulse server/null sink and must be explicitly invoked as documented in the
voice ledger.

## macOS alpha from a clone

On macOS 13 or newer, install Xcode Command Line Tools, Rust 1.95.0 with
`rustup`, Node.js, and CMake (needed to build Opus). From the repository root run:

```sh
./apps/rune/scripts/build-on-mac.sh
```

Cargo dependencies must be available via network or cache. The script builds for
the Mac's architecture and creates `rune-macos-alpha/Herune.app` and a ZIP,
using ad hoc signing. Pass a nonexistent output directory as the first argument
to choose another location. This signature is not Developer ID and the app is
not notarized. The macOS build and runtime have not yet been verified on a Mac.
The app connects to an existing Hermes gateway; it does not bundle the server.
